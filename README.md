# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install the dependencies with:
### `npm install`

## Get the Google Maps API Key
In src/GoogleMaps.js, on line 23, I have set my personal googleMapsApiKey. Please get a new API key through [GoogleMapsPlatform](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key), and replace the googleMapsApiKey with your googleMapsApiKey. 

## Run the application with:
### `npm start`
The project will be running on http://localhost:3000

## In case the depdencies are not correctly installed, try running these commands:
### `npm install @mui/icons-material`
### `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`
### `npm install axios --save`
### `npm install cors --save`
### `npm i -S @react-google-maps/api`
